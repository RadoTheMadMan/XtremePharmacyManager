NAME: XTreme Pharmacy Manager

DESCRIPTION:
The first release of XTremePharmacyManager information system, consisting of a database and a software and with the following features:
**REGULAR OPERATIONS** using stored procedures, Entity Model and LINQ queries, they are slow due to constant data reloading
**BULK OPERATIONS** using stored procedures and extensible template classes, allowing for extensibility and usage on any data type
**LOCALISATION** - can support as much languages as you add to its Resources.resx file, I will change that later if I decide
**APPLICATION SETTINGS** - to customise the application to the slightest detail
**ACCOUNT SETTINGS** - to customise your account while working
**STRICT LOGIN AND RBAC POLICIES** - has roles, requires login to the database to work and adapts to the permissions of your roles, hardcoded, even without encryption prevents intruders from gaining access if they aren't in the user data table in the information system, 'nuff said!!
**REPORT GENERATION** to generate reports for your company and the name of your company will be shown on it if you have configured the settings for it in the application to verify that the reports are yours!
**DOCUMENTATION** in Bulgarian and English to allow you to understand this system and ITS TEXT SHOUTS LOUDER THAN HELL!!!
**DATABASE DIAGRAMS** to show its bitter sweet evolution and how much we sacrificed
**AUTOMATED CALCULATION OF DATA** to help you with calculating prices of orders and/or user balance, no matter of their role and help you with your work showing again the symbiosis between a man and a machine
This is a robust pharmacy management system for pharmacy shops and/or pharmacies in general that will take your soul and help you with your job. Not the most secure and with ugly  design made only for functionality and/or extensibility so you can rock with it on your work and develop it further for your own needs. It is released in the MIT license and open to fork and/or develop because I haven't written all the code myself and I have used ChatGPT and help from the internet as well and besides, this was an university project and being open source fits it and OPEN SOURCE ROCKS!!! \m/
